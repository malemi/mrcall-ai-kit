## Report budget

Your report is read by the session that delegated to you, and every line of it
lands in a context window you exist to protect. At most **twenty lines**.

Never put in a report: a diff, a file listing, a stack trace, or more than three
consecutive lines of command output. When the evidence is longer than that,
write it to `$TMPDIR/mrcall-ai-kit/<task-id>/<your-agent-name>.log` and put that
path on the `Evidence:` line. Create the directory if it does not exist. It is
outside the repository on purpose — a worker's scratch output is not repository
knowledge and must never be one missing `.gitignore` line away from a commit.

The `Unverified:` line is never dropped for brevity. A short report that quietly
omits what you did not check is worse than a long one, and that line is the only
thing standing between a twenty-line budget and a confident-sounding lie.
